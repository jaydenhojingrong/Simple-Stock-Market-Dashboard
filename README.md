## Business Context
In order to facilitate discretionary management fund managers are often interested in not only looking at prices of stocks today but what they have been previously to gain further insight into companies.
## User Story

I want a single page application where I can select stocks on the US Stock Exchange and a date range (from and to date)
So that I can chart a time series of prices for the selected stocks and date range
## Acceptance Criteria
